	abstract = {School neighborhood violence continues to be a major public health problem among urban students. A large body of research addresses violence at school; however, fewer studies have explored concentrations of violence in areas proximal to schools. This study aimed to quantify the concentration of shootings near schools to elucidate the place-based dynamics that may be focal points for violence prevention. Geocoded databases of shooting and school locations were used to examine locational patterns of firearm shootings and elementary, middle, and high schools in Boston, Massachusetts. Analyses utilized spatial statistics for point pattern data including distance matrix and K function methodology to quantify the degree of spatial dependence of shootings around schools. Results suggested that between 2012 and 2015, there were 678 shooting incidents in Boston; the average density was 5.1 per square kilometer. The nearest neighbor index (NNI = 0.335 km, p {\textless} .001, O = 0.95 km, E = 0.28 km) and G function analysis revealed a clustered pattern of gun shooting incidents indicative of a spatially non-random process. The mean and median distance from any school to the nearest shooting location was 0.35 and 0.33 km, respectively. A majority (56\%, 74/133) of schools in Boston had at least one shooting incident within 400 m, a distance that would take about 5 min to walk if traveling by foot. The bivariate K function indicated that a significantly greater number of shootings were clustered within short distances from schools than would be expected under a null hypothesis of no spatial dependence. Implications for students attending schools in racially homogenous neighborhoods across all income levels are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) has created an urgent need to identify child abuse and neglect (CAN) and efficiently allocate re­ sources to improve the coordination of responses during a public health crisis.
Objective: To provide unique insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of CAN in relation to COVID-19 outcomes and identify areas where CAN has increased or decreased during the pandemic. Participants: Children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Setting: CAN incidents in the city of Los Angeles.
Methods: Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the imple­ mentation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored.
Results: There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions: Our findings reinforce the utility of developing intervention strategies that minimize harm to children by targeting resources to specific challenges facing families enduring the COVID19 experience.},

	abstract = {Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how violence exposure (e.g. child maltreatment, witnessing community violence) inﬂuence both externalizing and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms among children in foster care. Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n = 280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both signiﬁcantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the ﬁrst two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the eﬀect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.},

	abstract = {This study quantifies the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in Los Angeles at the census tract level over a recent 4-year period, identifies areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of structural disadvantage in substantiated child maltreatment referrals. Child maltreatment data on 83,379 child maltreatment cases in 1,678 census tracts spanning 2006-2009 were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Substantiated referral counts were analyzed across census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results showed that the unadjusted yearly rate of child abuse and neglect held fairly steady over the study period decreasing by only 2.57\%. However, the temporal term in the spatiotemporal model reflected a downward trend beginning in 2007. High rates of abuse and neglect were predicted by several neighborhood-level measures of structural burden. Every 1-unit decrease in the social vulnerability index reduced the risk of child abuse and neglect by 98.3\% (95\% CrI = 1.869-2.1042) while every 1-unit increase in the Black–White dissimilarity index decreased child abuse and neglect risk by 70.6\%. The interaction of these variables demonstrated the protective effect of racial heterogeneity in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. No such effect was found in neighborhoods characterized by low levels of vulnerability. Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns even after accounting for the role of race and place.},

Results showed significant patterns of spatial clustering (i.e., hot and cold spots) of CMAs across the county (Moran’s I ¼ .316, p {\textless} .001). A geographically weighted regression (GWR) was implemented to examine the relationship between CMAs and social vulnerability at the census-tract level, thereby overcoming the deficiencies of global models. Nonstationarity was detected across four indices of vulnerability (socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, household composition, and health vulnerability) as well as proximity to onpremise alcohol outlets, percentage of residents in each census tract affected by food deserts, and population density, in some cases showing countervailing effects depending on spatial location. A hierarchical clustering was performed on the GWR coefficients to identify spatial regimes, or clusters, across the county. The results yielded six spatial regimes of social vulnerability differentially related to CMA rates. The present study demonstrates the novelty of GWR in combination with a hierarchical cluster analysis for exploring how local contextual processes influence child maltreatment reporting rates across the county.},

	abstract = {Objectives. This study explores the predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors associated with parents' or guardians' decision to have their child initiate, continue, and complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Methods. Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 9 and 17 years who completed the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey collected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) were analyzed. Utilizing Andersen's health care beliefs model, we explored the sequential nature of the decision to vaccinate (i.e., the decision to receive the ﬁrst, second, and third dose), thereby allowing the independent variables to vary across each transition.
Results. Among all children, 3.7\% received exactly 1 shot, 16.3\% received at least one shot, and 8.9\% received all three shots. Among those who received at least one shot, 22.4\% received exactly one shot, 23.7\% received exactly 2 shots, and 54.9\% completed all 3 shots. A differential impact was observed across transitions. Predisposing factors, such as being Hispanic (OR = 1.9) and child age (OR = 1.4), signiﬁcantly predicted the decision to receive the ﬁrst dose but enabling factors, such as having a regular physician (OR = 4.5) and income (OR = .74) were more important for predicting completion.
Conclusions. The decision to initiate and complete HPV vaccination depends on a speciﬁc mix of enabling, predisposing, and need-based factors. Our analysis underscores the importance of modeling the vaccination decision in a manner that is consistent with how primary caregivers navigate real-life health care decisions for their children.},

Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model. The participants' initial levels of depressive and PTS symptomatology were signiﬁcantly and positively related; furthermore, any changes in these two outcomes were also correlated longitudinally. The initial assessment of PTS symptoms signiﬁcantly contributed to the advancement of more severe depressive symptoms over time. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between youth who remained in the home and those removed from the home. However, violence exposure, sexual abuse, gender and age were signiﬁcant predictors of level and rate of change in both PTS and depressive symptoms. PTS growth factors mediated the longitudinal relationship between witnessing severe violence and depressive symptoms. The ﬁndings suggest a complex developmental association between depressive and PTS symptomatology among CPS-involved youth that is rooted in early childhood experiences with complex trauma.},

The objective of this study was to examine the patterning of ACEs and to explore the resultant patterns’ association with HIV risk-taking, problem drinking, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous, mutually exclusive “classes” of 11 of the most commonly used ACEs. The LCA resulted in four high-risk profiles and one low-risk profile, which were labeled: (1) highly abusive and dysfunctional (3.3\%; n ¼ 1,983), (2) emotionally abusive alcoholic with parental conflict (6\%, n ¼ 3,303), (3) sexual abuse only (4.3\%, n ¼ 2,260), (4) emotionally abusive and alcoholic (30.3\%, n ¼ 17,460), and (5) normative, low risk (56.3\%, n ¼ 32,950). Compared to the low-risk class, each high-risk profile was differentially associated with adult psychosocial outcomes even when the conditional CR within that class was similar. The results further our understanding about the pattern of ACEs and the unique pathways to poor health. Implications for child welfare systems when dealing with individuals who have experienced multiple forms of early childhood maltreatment and/or household dysfunction are discussed.},

	abstract = {Physically abused youth are vulnerable to experiencing difficulties across multiple domains of school functioning. Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell’s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the “school achievement” effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children’s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.},

As well, an examination is conducted regarding the accessibility of Health Care Centers (HCCs) in relation to individuals in need of medical assistance. Distance-based measures of spatial association, including nearest neighbor and K-function analysis, were used to determine the clustering of calls at various spatial scales. Structural neighborhood characteristics (i.e., distance to the closest HCC) and physical and social vulnerability were used to predict the rate of calls for a heroinrelated injury per 1,000 persons in the city of Boston using a spatial autoregressive model. HCC catchment areas for the set of medical emergency calls were created using Voronoi tessellations. Results showed that the average nearest neighbor distance (NND) of each call for medical assistance was approximately 187 m or .12 miles. Calls for assistance became more probable and increasingly more spatially concentrated over the study period. The K-function analysis revealed that the calls clustered at different spatial scales and in proximity to HCCs. Average distance to the nearest HCC and Household/Disability vulnerability were significantly associated with the census tract call rate per 1,000 persons. The average travel distance between the calls for medical assistance and the nearest HCC was 941 m, or just over a half-mile. Policy implications for the provision, through HCCs, of a focused and comprehensive community-based support system in a large urban city for individuals with serious drug problems are discussed in context.},

	abstract = {Background: Modeling the spatio-temporal characteristics of substantiated child maltreatment risk has signiﬁcant implications for child welfare policy.
Objective: This study quantiﬁes the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in New Mexico at the census tract level over 9 years, identiﬁes areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of multiple measures of social and housing insecurity on substantiated child maltreatment referrals. Participants and Setting: Child maltreatment substantiation data across 499 census tracts from 2007 to 2015 were obtained from the New Mexico Department of Public Health.
Methods: Substantiated referral counts were analyzed within census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical space-time models using Laplace approximation. Standardized incidence ratios, spatial risk, and probability exceedances were calculated and mapped.
Results: Multiple neighborhood structural factors were associated with an increased risk of substantiated child maltreatment, including the eviction rate (Incidence Density Ratio [IDR] = 1.09 [95 \% CrI = 1.01–1.12]), rent burden (IDR = 1.11 [95 \% CrI = 1.01–1.13]), urban tracts (IDR = 1.36 [95 \% CrI = 1.05–1.77]), food desert tracts (IDR = 1.21 [95 \% CrI = 1.04–1.41]), low income tracts (IDR = 1.27 [95 \% CrI = 1.09–1.49]), percent of households with no vehicle access ([IDR] = 1.27 [95 \% CrI = .247–6.47]), and percent of persons with a disability (IDR = 1.05 [95 \% CrI = 1.03–1.06]). The racial/ethnic diversity ratio, however, was associated with lower incidence of child maltreatment allegation risk (IDR = .988 [95 \% CrI = .982–.995]).
Conclusions: Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention eﬀorts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns of household and housing vulnerability, particularly in low income, racially segregated neighborhoods.},

Little is known, however, about the course of dual trajectories of cooccurring depressive symptoms and PSE or its impact on children’s socioemotional development. This study sought to identify trajectories of postpartum PSE and depressive symptoms in new, first-time mothers using growth mixture modeling. Results demonstrated a class of women with “low risk” (88.8\%) who manifested low levels of depression and high levels of PSE during the postpartum period; a second group of women, labeled “early risk” (6.3\%) with high levels of depression that decreased over time but lower levels of PSE that remained fairly stable; and a final trajectory group deemed the “laterisk” class (4.9\%) with initially low levels of depression and high levels of PSE that significantly increased and decreased, respectively, over the period. Early childhood trauma, parenting stress, and poor parenting practices were associated membership in a high-risk class. Mothers in the high-risk groups reported children with more aggressive and defiant behavior at age 3. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for developing effective and sensitive interventions.},

	abstract = {Parenting stress (PS) is prospectively associated with children’s lowered socio-emotional functioning; however, little is known about the antecedents and consequences of changes in postpartum parenting stress and its relationship to problematic behaviors in early childhood. This research examined the longitudinal relationships between multiple measures of cognitive readiness to parent, parenting stress (initial level and growth) and child social-emotional competence at age 3. It was hypothesized that lack of cognitive readiness to parent would predict initial level and growth in PS and that initial level and change in parenting stress would, in turn, would be related to poor social-emotional development. Cognitive readiness to parent was assessed at baseline shortly after childbirth; parenting stress, conceptualized as diﬃcult child, parent-child dysfunction and parental distress, was assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postpartum (i.e. when children were 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years of age) using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1995); children’s socio-emotional functioning was assessed with behavioral rating scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) (BSID-II; Bayley, 1993) which was administered by professionals at age 3. Using a second order growth curve, or curve-of-factors model, the study’s hypotheses were tested with data from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study (2001–2007), a longitudinal study of 682 ﬁrst-time mothers. Results from the latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that parenting stress predicted child socio-emotional problems. Speciﬁcally, mothers who began parenthood with high stress levels had children with lower levels of pro-social functioning (i.e. more behavior problems). Two measures of cognitive readiness to parent were associated with lower levels of postpartum PS at baseline but social support moderated the relationship between readiness to parent and parenting stress. Implications for interventions aimed at identifying families with children at risk for emotional and developmental problems and/ or new parents who demonstrate changes in parenting stress during the postpartum period are discussed in context.},

However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to formulate and analyze such models which feature game-environment feedback. For instance, a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors of a victim population? For initial answers, we develop a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. We then apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximallycautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need.
Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using χ2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment.
Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20–39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites.
Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.},

A random sample of 452 adults with elderly relatives, older than 65 years, and in nursing home care completed a telephone survey regarding elder abuse and neglect experienced by this elder family member in the care setting. Some 24.3\% of respondents reported at least one incident of physical abuse by nursing home staff. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the importance of various risk factors in nursing home abuse. Limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), older adult behavioral difﬁculties, and previous victimization by nonstaff perpetrators were associated with a greater likelihood of physical abuse. Interventions that address these risk factors may be effective in reducing older adult physical abuse in nursing homes. Attention to the contextual or ecological character of nursing home abuse is essential, particularly in light of the ﬁndings of this study.},

The sample consisted of 350 transgender men and women who participated in the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS). Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the competing outcomes associated with suicidal risk. Thirtyseven percent of trans men and women experienced at least one physical attack since the age of 13. On average, individuals experienced 3.97 (SD = 2.86) physical attacks; among these about half were attributed to one's gender identity or expression (mean = 2.08, SD = 1.96). In the multivariate multinomial regression, compared to those with no risk, being physically attacked increased the odds of both attempting and contemplating suicide regardless of gender attribution. Nevertheless, the relative impact of physical victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression. Finally, no significant association was found between multiple measures of institutional discrimination and suicide risk once discriminatory and non-discriminatory physical victimization was taken into account. Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives.},

He then performed meta-regression adjusting for location, risk and MC prevalence. When one or two of these adjustments in combination were applied MC appeared protective, but when all three were introduced the association remained signiﬁcant in high-risk populations, but not in general populations within Africa with a hypothetical MC prevalence of {\textless}25\% or elsewhere with hypothetical MC prevalence of {\textless}75\%. However, many MC prevalence values given differed from those reported in references cited (including all US studies). This and other problems invalidate his adjustments for MC prevalence, undermining most of his meta-regression results. Meta-regression is a highly sophisticated statistical tool and is prone to error if not applied correctly. The study contained a high risk of bias arising from confounding. We also question his use of crude, rather than adjusted, odds ratios and his inclusion of unpublished data, so precluding replication by others. Flawed statistics, opaque presentation of results and inclusion of previously repudiated arguments downplaying a role for MC in HIV prevention programmes should lead readers to be sceptical of the ﬁndings and conclusions of Van Howe’s study.},

Stress, in the context of caregiving relationships, is a risk factor associated with increased prevalence of elder abuse in familial and institutional settings. As increasing numbers of older adults are moved from family caregiving to nursing home care settings, it becomes important to identify the pattern of elder abuse risk factors in nursing home facilities. An ecological model is proposed for better understanding the risk factors associated with elder abuse in nursing homes and the complex interaction of individual/person characteristics and contextual factors in institutional elder abuse. An ecological perspective to institutional elder abuse provides a framework for guiding and informing future research on the risk factors of nursing home abuse and, in turn, for the development of effective interventions and relevant social policies.},

	abstract = {Studies of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have gauged severity using a cumulative risk (CR) index. Few studies have focused on the nature of the context of adversity and their association with psychosocial outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the patterning of ACEs and to explore the resultant patterns? association with HIV risk-taking, problem drinking, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous, mutually exclusive ?classes? of 11 of the most commonly used ACEs. The LCA resulted in four high-risk profiles and one low-risk profile, which were labeled: (1) highly abusive and dysfunctional (3.3\%; n = 1,983), (2) emotionally abusive alcoholic with parental conflict (6\%, n = 3,303), (3) sexual abuse only (4.3\%, n = 2,260), (4) emotionally abusive and alcoholic (30.3\%, n = 17,460), and (5) normative, low risk (56.3\%, n = 32,950). Compared to the low-risk class, each high-risk profile was differentially associated with adult psychosocial outcomes even when the conditional CR within that class was similar. The results further our understanding about the pattern of ACEs and the unique pathways to poor health. Implications for child welfare systems when dealing with individuals who have experienced multiple forms of early childhood maltreatment and/or household dysfunction are discussed.},

	abstract = {Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how violence exposure (e.g. child maltreatment, witnessing community violence) influence both externalizing and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms among children in foster care. Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n=280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both significantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the first two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the effect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.},

	abstract = {Background: The population living in urban areas is growing rapidly. The level of exposure to adverse envi­ ronmental factors is detrimental to human health and is directly related to urban and transport planning practices.
Objective: To estimate the premature mortality burden of non-compliance with international exposure guidelines for air pollution, noise, access to green space and heat for Barcelona and Madrid (Spain), and its distribution among the population by the socioeconomic status (SES).
Methods: The Urban and TranspOrt planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool was applied and the attributable premature mortality due to non-compliance with recommended exposure levels was estimated. The distribution of the attributable mortality burden among the population by SES was investigated through Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) adjusting for spatial autocorrelation and a cluster analysis was performed to identify attributable mortality hot spots.
Results: Annually, 7.1\% and 3.4\% of premature mortality in Barcelona and Madrid, respectively, could be attributed to non-compliance with the international exposure recommendations for air pollution, noise, heat and access to green space. In addition, analysis by SES showed that in Barcelona lower SES areas had an overall greater attributable mortality rate, while in Madrid, the distribution of the attributable mortality burden by SES varied by exposure.
Conclusion: This study shows the impact of environmental exposures on mortality and highlights the importance of taking integrated actions when designing cities considering the health impacts, but also the specificities of each city such as the socio-demographic context. Moreover, the high precision scale of the analysis enables the identification of environmental hazards and mortality hot spots providing a powerful tool to support prioritysetting and guide policymakers towards a healthy, sustainable and just city for all of their residents.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need.
Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using χ2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment.
Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20–39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites.
Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Monitoring the spatial and temporal course of opioid-related drug overdose mortality is
a key public health determinant. Despite previous studies exploring the evolution of
drug-related fatalities following the stay-at-home mandates during the COVID-19
pandemic, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics that mitigation efforts had
on overdose deaths. The purpose of this study was to describe the spatial and
temporal dynamics of overdose death relative risk using a 4-week interval over a span
of 5-months following the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown in the city of
Chicago, Illinois. A Bayesian space time model was used to produce posterior risk
estimates and exceedance probabilities of opioid-related overdose deaths controlling
for measures of area level deprivation and stay-at-home mandates. We found that
area-level temporal risk and inequalities in drug overdose mortality increased
significantly in the initial months of the pandemic. We further found that a change in the
area level deprivation from the first to the fourth quintile increased the relative risk of a
drug overdose risk by 44.5\%. The social distancing index measuring the proportion of
persons who stayed at home in each census block group was not associated with drug
overdose mortality. We conclude by highlighting the importance of contextualizing the
spatial and temporal risk in overdose mortality for implementing effective and safe
harm reduction strategies during a global pandemic.},

	abstract = {Network analysis is increasingly being used to explore interrelationships between symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS); nevertheless, no study to date has applied network theory to explore PTS in youth who are tran­ sitioning from foster care to independence. The present study estimated Adaptive LASSO and relative importance networks of PTS symptoms using the CIDI-PTSD Short Form (CIDI-SF) index from the Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs Study (2001–2010). Graph-theoretic algorithms including community detection and minimum spanning tree (MST; a unique, acyclic subnetwork with a fixed number of connections) were imple­ mented to identify interconnected network symptom clusters. Two symptoms of emotional numbing (restricted affect and feeling detached) and two symptoms of intrusive reexperiencing (flashbacks, distressing dreams) emerged as the most important items in the network. The MST algorithm further revealed a backbone structure of PTSD that was centered on negative evaluations of the future. Feedback loops within the network were identified as well as symptoms that were highly predictive and potentially causal. Results strongly suggest that emotional numbing is a central aspect of psychopathology following experiences of complex trauma and home removal that merits special consideration in the diagnostic and treatment evaluation process of youth involved in the foster care system.},

	abstract = {Physically abused youth are vulnerable to experiencing difficulties across multiple domains of school functioning. Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell?s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ?school achievement? effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children?s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.},

	abstract = {Studies of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have gauged severity using a cumulative risk (CR) index. Few studies have focused on the nature of the context of adversity and their association with psychosocial outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the patterning of ACEs and to explore the resultant patterns’ association with HIV risk-taking, problem drinking, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous, mutually exclusive “classes” of 11 of the most commonly used ACEs. The LCA resulted in four high-risk profiles and one low-risk profile, which were labeled: (1) highly abusive and dysfunctional (3.3\%; n ¼ 1,983), (2) emotionally abusive alcoholic with parental conflict (6\%, n ¼ 3,303), (3) sexual abuse only (4.3\%, n ¼ 2,260), (4) emotionally abusive and alcoholic (30.3\%, n ¼ 17,460), and (5) normative, low risk (56.3\%, n ¼ 32,950). Compared to the low-risk class, each high-risk profile was differentially associated with adult psychosocial outcomes even when the conditional CR within that class was similar. The results further our understanding about the pattern of ACEs and the unique pathways to poor health. Implications for child welfare systems when dealing with individuals who have experienced multiple forms of early childhood maltreatment and/or household dysfunction are discussed.},

            Postpartum depression and low parental self‐efficacy (PSE) are risk factors for poor child behavior. Little is known, however, about the course of dual trajectories of cooccurring depressive symptoms and PSE or its impact on children's socioemotional development. This study sought to identify trajectories of postpartum PSE and depressive symptoms in new, first‐time mothers using growth mixture modeling. Results demonstrated a class of women with “low risk” (88.8\%) who manifested low levels of depression and high levels of PSE during the postpartum period; a second group of women, labeled “early risk” (6.3\%) with high levels of depression that decreased over time but lower levels of PSE that remained fairly stable; and a final trajectory group deemed the “late‐risk” class (4.9\%) with initially low levels of depression and high levels of PSE that significantly increased and decreased, respectively, over the period. Early childhood trauma, parenting stress, and poor parenting practices were associated membership in a high‐risk class. Mothers in the high‐risk groups reported children with more aggressive and defiant behavior at age 3. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for developing effective and sensitive interventions.

            Resumen
            La depresión posterior al parto y la autoeficacia de los padres (PSE) son factores de riesgo para la débil conducta del niño. Poco se sabe, sin embargo, acerca del curso de las trayectorias duales de síntomas depresivos que ocurren simultáneamente y PSE o su impacto en el desarrollo socioemocional de los niños. Este estudio se propuso identificar las trayectorias del PSE posterior al parto y los síntomas depresivos en nuevas, primerizas mamás usando un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento. Los resultados mostraron una clase de mujeres con ‘bajo riesgo’ (88.8\%) que manifestaron bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de PSE durante el período posterior al parto; un segundo grupo de mujeres, llamado ‘de temprano riesgo’ (6.3\%) con altos niveles de depresión que disminuyeron a lo largo del tiempo, pero más bajos niveles de PSE que se mantuvieron equitativamente estables; y un final grupo de trayectoria denominado la clase del ‘riesgo tardío’ (4.9\%) con iniciales bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de PSE que significativamente aumentaron y disminuyeron, respectivamente, a lo largo del período. El trauma en la temprana niñez, el estés de crianza, así como las débiles prácticas de crianza fueron afiliaciones asociadas dentro de una clase de alto riesgo. Las mamás en los grupos de alto riesgo reportaron niños con conductas más agresivas y desafiantes a la edad de tres años. Concluimos con una discusión de las implicaciones de nuestros resultados para desarrollar intervenciones eficaces y sensibles.

            Résumé
            La dépression postpartum et l'auto‐efficacité parentale (abrégé en français ici AEP) sont des facteurs de risque pour les problèmes de comportement de l'enfant. On sait peu de choses, cependant, à propos du cours des trajectoires duels des symptômes dépressifs concomitants et l'AEP ou son impact sur le développement socio‐émotionnel des enfants. Cette étude a cherché à identifier les trajectoires d'AEP postpartum et de symptômes dépressifs chez des mères étant mères pour la première fois, en utilisant un modèle de croissance mixte. Les résultats ont fait état d'une classe de femmes avec un “risque moindre” (88,8\%) qui faisaient preuve de niveaux peu élevés de dépression et de niveaux élevés d'AEP durant la période postpartum; un deuxième groupe de femmes, appelé “risque précoce” (6,3\%) avec des niveaux élevés de dépression qui ont décru au fil du temps et avec des niveaux plus bas d'AEP qui restaient relativement stables; et un groupe de trajectoire finale estimé comme étant la classe de ‘risque tardif’ (4,9\%) avec initialement des niveaux moindres de dépression et des niveaux élevés d'AEP qui ont respectivement augmenté et baissé de manière importante, au fil de cette période. Le trauma de la petite enfance, le stress de parentage et de mauvaises pratiques parentales étaient liés à l'appartenance à la classe à haut risque. Les mères des groupes à risque élevé ont fait état d'enfants avec un comportement plus agressif et défiant à l’âge de trois ans. Nous concluons en discutant les implications pour le développement d'interventions efficaces et sensibles.

            Zusammenfassung
            Duale Verläufe elterlicher Selbstwirksamkeit sowie depressiver Symptomatik bei postpartalen Müttern und deren Auswirkungen auf die sozio‐emotionale Anpassung im frühen Kindesalter: Ein Growth Mixture Modell
            Postpartale Depression und elterliche Selbstwirksamkeit (parental self‐efficacy; PSE) sind Risikofaktoren für nachteiliges kindliches Verhalten. Es ist jedoch wenig bekannt über den Verlauf gemeinsam auftretender depressiver Symptomatik und PSE oder deren Auswirkung auf die sozio‐emotionale Entwicklung der Kinder. In dieser Studie wurde versucht, mit Hilfe von Growth Mixture Modellierung Verläufe von postpartaler PSE und depressiver Symptomatik bei Erstgebärenden zu identifizieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigten drei Gruppen auf. Die erste Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “niedrigem Risiko” (88,8\%), die während der postpartalen Phase niedrige Depressions‐ und hohe PSE‐Werte hatten. Die zweite Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “frühem Risiko” (6,3\%), die anfänglich hohe aber im Laufe der Zeit abnehmende Depressionswerte und niedrigere, ziemlich stabil bleibenden PSE‐Werte hatten. Die letzte Verlaufs‐Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “spätem Risiko” (4,9\%), die anfänglich niedrige Depressions‐ und hohe PSE‐Werte hatten, die im Laufe der Zeit signifikant anstiegen bzw. abnahmen. Frühkindliches Trauma, elterlicher Stress und nachteilige Erziehungspraktiken waren mit der Zugehörigkeit zu einer Hochrisikoklasse assoziiert. Mütter in den Hochrisikogruppen berichteten von Kindern mit mehr aggressivem und trotzigem Verhalten im Alter von drei Jahren. Abschließend werden die Implikationen unserer Ergebnisse für die Entwicklung effektiver und sensibler Interventionen diskutiert.

            第一子産後の母親における育児自己効力感及び抑うつ症状と早期幼児期の社会情緒的適応の2つの軌跡:成長混合モデル
            産後うつと育児自己効力感 (PSE) は子どもの問題行動を引き起こす危険因子である。しかし、併発する抑うつ症状と自己効力感あるいはその影響による子どもの社会情緒の発達がたどる2つの軌跡についてはほとんど知られていない。この研究は成長混合モデリングを用いて、第一子産後の母親に生じる育児自己効力感と抑うつ症状の軌跡を同定しようとするものである。結果は以下のようであった。‘低リスク’の女性グループ (88.8％) は、産後の抑うつレベルが低く、育児自己効力感が高かった。第二グループ (6.3％) の女性は‘早期リスク’とされ、抑うつレベルが高くても時間経過で治まるものだが、育児自己効力感は低くその後も変わらない。最後の軌跡のグループ (4.9％) は‘後期リスク’と見なされるが、はじめ抑うつレベルは低く育児自己効力感は高いのだが、時を経る中でそれぞれ大幅に上がり、そして下がる。早期幼児期のトラウマ、育児ストレス、そして未熟な育児実践が、高リスクに伴って見られた。高リスクグループの母親は3歳時の子どもが攻撃的で反抗的だったと報告した。私達は、この研究結果の意味を検討して効果的で慎重な介入を開発することとする。

            المسارات المزدوجة للفعالية الذاتية للتربية الوالدية وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجديدات بعد الولادة والتكيف الاجتماعي العاطفي في مرحلة الطفولة المبكرة: نموذج خليط النمو
            الاكتئاب بعد الولادة والفعالية الذاتية للوالدين(PSE) هي عوامل خطر لسوء سلوك الطفل. ومع ذلك، لا يعرف الكثير عن تطور المسار المزدوج لأعراض الاكتئاب المتزامنة والكفاءة الذاتية للتربية الوالدية أو تأثيرها على النمو الاجتماعي العاطفي للأطفال. سعت هذه الدراسة إلى تحديد مساراتPSE بعد الولادة وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجدد لأول مرة باستخدام نمذجة خليط النمو . وأظهرت النتائج وجود فئة من النساء ذوات “المخاطر المنخفضة” (88.8 في المائة) من النساء اللاتي أظهرن مستويات منخفضة من الاكتئاب ومستويات عالية من PSE خلال فترة ما بعد الولادة؛ ومجموعة ثانية من النساء، وصفت ب “الخطر المبكر” (6.3٪) مع مستويات عالية من الاكتئاب انخفضت مع مرور الوقت ومستويات منخفضة من PSE والتي ظلت مستقرة إلى حد ما. كما وجدت مجموعة أخيرة وصفت بمجموعة “المخاطر المتأخرة” (4.9٪) مع مستويات منخفضة في البداية من الاكتئاب وارتفاع مستويات PSE والتي زادت وانخفضت بشكل ملحوظ ، على التوالي، على مدى فترة الدراسة. وارتبطت صدمة الطفولة المبكرة، والإجهاد الأبوي، وسوء ممارسات التربية بالانتماء إلى أحد هذه المجموعات ذات المخاطرة العالية. وأبلغت الأمهات في فئات المخاطرة العالية عن أطفال يعانون من سلوك أكثر عدوانية وعناداً في سن الثالثة. وتختم الدراسة بمناقشة تطبيقات النتائج لتطوير تدخلات فعالة وحساسة.},

	abstract = {This study quantifies the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in Los Angeles at the census tract level over a recent 4-year period, identifies areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of structural disadvantage in substantiated child maltreatment referrals. Child maltreatment data on 83,379 child maltreatment cases in 1,678 census tracts spanning 2006-2009 were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Substantiated referral counts were analyzed across census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results showed that the unadjusted yearly rate of child abuse and neglect held fairly steady over the study period decreasing by only 2.57\%. However, the temporal term in the spatiotemporal model reflected a downward trend beginning in 2007. High rates of abuse and neglect were predicted by several neighborhood-level measures of structural burden. Every 1-unit decrease in the social vulnerability index reduced the risk of child abuse and neglect by 98.3\% (95\% CrI = 1.869-2.1042) while every 1-unit increase in the Black–White dissimilarity index decreased child abuse and neglect risk by 70.6\%. The interaction of these variables demonstrated the protective effect of racial heterogeneity in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. No such effect was found in neighborhoods characterized by low levels of vulnerability. Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns even after accounting for the role of race and place.},
