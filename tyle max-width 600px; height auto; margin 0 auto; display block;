[31m-        Our work bridges law, public health, and statistics by combining geospatial methods and participatory approaches to address structural inequities. We translate complex spatial and legal analysis into actionable insights that support communities most affected by violence, childhood adversity, and harmful environmental exposures.[m

         Our work is driven by advances in machine learning, geospatial science, and the growing availability of big data. We focus on applying these tools to investigate how environmental exposuresâ€”such as neighborhood disinvestment, surveillance, and built environment risksâ€”contribute to harm and system involvement. Our goal is to translate data into legal, policy, and practice solutions that promote the health and well-being of children, adolescents, and families. We use advanced methodsâ€”including Bayesian spatial models, geographically weighted regression, and geospatial machine learningâ€”to examine how environmental exposures and spatial structures influence key outcomes such as child abuse, gun violence, adverse childhood experiences, and intimate partner violence. Our transdisciplinary approach brings together geospatial science, law, and public health to produce actionable insights for lawyers, judges, and policymakers, with a particular focus on housing and food security.[m
