description: "This project applies structural topic modeling (STM) and natural language processing (NLP) to strengthen structural mitigation in capital defense. By analyzing unstructured narrative records from child death reviews, STM identifies hidden thematic patterns that illustrate how exposure to poverty, violence, systemic neglect, and environmental disadvantage shapes developmental trajectories relevant to culpability and sentencing. This approach generates objective, place-based, legally admissible evidence consistent with Ohio law and ABA mitigation standards."

# Applying Structural Topic Modeling to Structural Mitigation in Capital Defense

![](/featured.png)

**Summary:**  
This project applies structural topic modeling (STM) and natural language processing (NLP) to strengthen structural mitigation in capital defense. By analyzing unstructured narrative records from child death reviews, STM identifies hidden thematic patterns that illustrate how exposure to poverty, violence, systemic neglect, and environmental disadvantage shapes developmental trajectories relevant to culpability and sentencing. This approach generates objective, place-based, legally admissible evidence consistent with Ohio law and ABA mitigation standards.

**Research Questions:**  
- **RQ1:** How can STM and NLP uncover latent themes in narrative records that reflect exposure to structural and environmental disadvantage over the life course?  
- **RQ2:** How can these data-driven patterns be integrated into capital case mitigation to contextualize life outcomes, support fairness in sentencing, and meet legal standards for structural mitigation?

| **Short description:**   | This project uses structural topic modeling and NLP to analyze unstructured child fatality review narratives, revealing hidden patterns of systemic disadvantage, environmental stress, and developmental risk relevant to culpability and sentencing in capital defense.                           |
