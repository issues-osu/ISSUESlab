## Child Neglect as a Public Health & Civil Rights Crisis

**Legal context:** Under California WIC § 300(b)(1), neglect is the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision, placing a child at risk of serious harm. Our lab approaches neglect as both a **public health** and **civil rights** issue shaped by place.

### Why place matters
- Neglect risk is not only individual or familial—it’s structured by neighborhoods.
- Housing quality, access to healthy food, environmental hazards, and local safety often align with legal definitions of neglect.

### How we “read” environments with AI & geospatial data
- **Street-level imagery:** Systematically collect images via **ZenSVI** and **Mapillary**.
- **Objective features (semantic segmentation):** Quantify visible elements (e.g., vegetation, sidewalks, buildings) per image.
- **Subjective perceptions (PlacePulse-style models):** Score images for safety, upkeep, boredom/depressiveness.
- **Neighborhood data integration:** Combine imagery-derived measures with the **Area Deprivation Index**, **Tree Equity Score**, and geocoded child neglect reports.
- **Spatial statistical modeling:** Relate social/physical environmental factors to neglect reports.

### What we learn (implications for child welfare systems)
- **Isolate risk factors:** Identify objective (green space, infrastructure) and subjective (perceived safety/upkeep) features associated with neglect risk.
- **Target high-risk locations:** Detect where environmental exposures align most strongly with neglect.
- **Assess policy relevance:** Evaluate whether legal mandates reflect measurable neighborhood conditions.

### Related ISSUES Lab methods
- **Structural Topic Models (STMs):** Extract themes from narratives (e.g., fatality reports, police incidents) and map them.
- **Spatial Random Forests:** Predict and map violence-related harms; rank influential environmental and social factors.
- **Predictive analytics:** Clarify when algorithms aid prevention vs. risk reinforcing inequities.
