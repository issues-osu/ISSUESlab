  <p>Our lab investigates the structural and environmental determinants of violence-related harm, including firearm injury, suicide, intimate partner violence, and child maltreatment. We study how neighborhood disadvantage, racialized disinvestment, housing instability, and environmental exposures interact with policy and social systems to shape risks and resilience across communities. By integrating law, public health, and data science, we work to identify pathways for prevention and justice-centered interventions.</p>

  <h2>Core Questions We Address</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do patterns of firearm injury, suicide, child maltreatment, and domestic violence cluster across neighborhoods and populations?</li>
    <li>What environmental and structural factors (e.g., alcohol outlet density, green space, heat exposure, housing precarity) exacerbate or mitigate these harms?</li>
    <li>How can spatial and statistical models improve our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to violence-related risks?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methods and Approaches</h2>
  <p>We use a combination of geospatial epidemiology, Bayesian modeling, machine learning, and participatory research to analyze violence-related harms and inform prevention strategies. Our work often involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mapping firearm injuries, suicides, and child welfare reports at the neighborhood level</li>
    <li>Linking law, policy, and environmental exposures with health and justice outcomes</li>
    <li>Collaborating with community organizations, public defenders, and policymakers to develop structural interventions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
  <p>Current studies include spatial modeling of non-fatal firearm injuries in Chicago, Bayesian analyses of suicide risk and environmental inequities in Cook County, investigation of intimate partner violence during pregnancy and its effects on maternal and child health, and examination of how child maltreatment risk is shaped by neighborhood environments in Los Angeles. These projects emphasize place-based prevention and structural policy change.</p>
