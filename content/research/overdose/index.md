  <p>Our lab studies how substance use, overdose risk, and recovery are influenced by neighborhood conditions, social inequities, and policy environments. We examine how factors such as poverty, racialized disinvestment, housing instability, and access to treatment services intersect with the opioid crisis and other forms of substance use. Using spatial and statistical methods, we aim to identify community-level drivers of risk and resilience, and to evaluate the role of recovery housing in supporting individuals in long-term recovery.</p>

  <h2>Core Questions We Address</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do patterns of drug use, overdose, and recovery vary across neighborhoods, demographic groups, and time?</li>
    <li>What environmental and social factors (e.g., housing, healthcare access, social safety nets) contribute to overdose risk or recovery success?</li>
    <li>How do policies, such as Medicaid expansion, recovery housing initiatives, or harm reduction programs, shape treatment access and outcomes?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methods and Approaches</h2>
  <p>We use a mix of geospatial data science, spatial epidemiology, and policy analysis to evaluate how environments and systems affect drug use, overdose, and recovery. Our work often involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mapping overdose events, treatment access, and recovery housing at the neighborhood level</li>
    <li>Integrating health, administrative, and spatial data to model overdose risk and recovery pathways</li>
    <li>Partnering with community organizations, recovery housing networks, healthcare providers, and policymakers to develop equitable prevention and treatment strategies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
  <p>Current studies include analysis of how Medicaid policy changes influence opioid treatment access, evaluations of recovery housing and harm reduction initiatives, and spatial modeling of overdose clusters to inform targeted public health interventions. This work directly informs community-based strategies and policy reforms aimed at reducing overdose deaths and supporting sustained recovery.</p>
