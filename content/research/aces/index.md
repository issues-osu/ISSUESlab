 <p>Our lab explores how early life adversity—including abuse, neglect, and household challenges —interacts with environmental and structural factors such as housing instability, poverty, and racial inequity. We apply spatial and statistical methods to better understand how these experiences cluster in urban space and contribute to long-term disparities in health, education, and justice involvement.</p>

  <h2>Core Questions We Address</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do ACEs vary across neighborhoods and demographic groups?</li>
    <li>What community-level factors (e.g., green space, school quality, social services) buffer or exacerbate their impact?</li>
    <li>Can we predict future risk of ACE-related outcomes using spatial machine learning?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methods and Approaches</h2>
  <p>We use a mix of geospatial data science, longitudinal modeling, and participatory research with community partners to develop evidence-informed policy recommendations and intervention strategies. Our work often involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mapping and modeling ACE risk at the neighborhood level</li>
    <li>Combining survey data with built environment indicators</li>
    <li>Collaborating with schools, child welfare agencies, and public health organizations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
  <p>Current studies include analysis of how exposure to ACEs relates to educational attainment and justice system involvement, with special focus on intervention points for prevention through environmental design, family supports, and systems coordination.</p>
