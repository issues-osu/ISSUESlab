  <p>Our lab studies how reproductive health access—including abortion, prenatal care, and maternal health services—is shaped by structural inequities, neighborhood conditions, and policy environments. We examine how abortion restrictions, domestic violence, and social determinants of health intersect to produce disparities in maternal and child outcomes. Using spatial and statistical methods, we identify community-level drivers of risk and resilience to inform prevention and policy change.</p>

  <h2>Core Questions We Address</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do abortion restrictions and reproductive health policies vary across states and neighborhoods, and how do these differences impact maternal and child health?</li>
    <li>What is the relationship between domestic violence during pregnancy and adverse outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and maternal morbidity?</li>
    <li>What community and policy-level factors (e.g., Medicaid coverage, availability of clinics, social safety nets) buffer or exacerbate reproductive health inequities?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methods and Approaches</h2>
  <p>We use a mix of geospatial analysis, longitudinal cohort data, and policy evaluation to understand the connections between reproductive health access, violence, and health outcomes. Our work often involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mapping reproductive health service availability and abortion access across neighborhoods</li>
    <li>Linking PRAMS, hospital, and administrative data with environmental and social determinants</li>
    <li>Collaborating with community health centers, legal advocates, and policymakers to strengthen reproductive justice frameworks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
  <p>Current studies include spatial analysis of abortion access and maternal health disparities, investigation of the impact of domestic violence during pregnancy on birth outcomes, and evaluation of Medicaid and safety net reforms to improve reproductive health equity.</p>
