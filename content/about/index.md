We are a multidisciplinary research group comprised of underrepresented scholars in the academy. Our work focuses on using geographic data science in social work policy and practice at the [Colleges of Social Work (https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) and Public Health](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) at The [Ohio State University (OSU)](http://www.osu.edu), a leading global university based in Columbus, Ohio.

Our mission is to leverage and make sense of big geospatial data at different scales for urban applications and catalyse the development of spatial data infrastructures and digital twins in the realm of smart cities and the built environment.
We are particularly interested in the interface of emerging urban datasets such as street-level imagery, dynamic/sensor data, and 3D city models with the state of the art of artificial intelligence to solve contemporary urban challenges and provide a strong foundation to advance urban informatics.
Crowdsourcing plays an important role in our research, as we follow and contribute to the vibrant and impressive developments in Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and engage such data in our advancements.

Dr. Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno created the research group in 2023. Motivated primarily by a desire to effectuate systemic reform, particularly in child welfre, criminal justice and juvenile justice. You can read more about our research agenda [here](research). We are particularly interested in bringing urban analytics and geospatial analysis to examine the spatial distribution of violence in urban areas. Below is an example map we created in one of our most recent manuscripts that uses computational network analysis to understand firearm-related harm in Compton, California.

We are involved in several community-based and academic collaborations such as the [Ohio Policy Evaluation Network (OPEN)](https://open.osu.edu/) and the [Franklin County Public Defender](https://defender.franklincountyohio.gov/).
