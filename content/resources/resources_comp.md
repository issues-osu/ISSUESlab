## Notes for Students
- Always install **R before RStudio**.  
- Use **Zotero with the browser connector** for easy reference saving.  
- If new to GitHub, check the **GitHub Student Developer Pack** for free private repos and tools.  
- For spatial analysis, **QGIS** is sufficient, but you may also want to try **GeoDa** ([https://geodacenter.github.io/](https://geodacenter.github.io/)) for exploratory spatial data analysis.
