Our work on the structural mitigation was presented at the Ohio State Bar Association conference on the death penalty at the Ohio Supreme Court in May 2025e. 

> One of the most common tools used in mitigation defense is the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. These experiences are often introduced to demonstrate diminished culpability, impaired development, or increased vulnerability in the client.

They provide a clinical and developmental framework for understanding the long-term effects of trauma.

The original framework, which I refer to here as Conventional ACEs or C-ACEs, focuses on family-level adversities. This includes things like physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; neglect; and growing up in a household with substance abuse, domestic violence, or incarceration. These are experiences that happen within the home, usually before the age of 18.

But more recently, researchers and practitioners have pushed for an expanded view—what we call Expanded ACEs or E-ACEs. This broader framework includes adversities that occur outside the household, such as:– Racial and gender discrimination– Exposure to community violence– Chronic poverty or economic hardship– Involvement in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems

Expanded ACEs (E-ACEs) represent a meaningful improvement by including individual-level exposure to community violence, racial and gender discrimination, poverty, and system involvement—adversities that happen beyond the household and are deeply relevant to many of our clients.
But even E-ACEs do not go far enough. They still locate adversity at the individual level—

Take, for instance, the difference between experiencing racial discrimination at school and growing up in a hypersegregated, disinvested community of color—a place shaped by decades of redlining, de jure segregation, and economic exclusion. The first is about an individual incident; the second is about a historical and spatial system of harm.
