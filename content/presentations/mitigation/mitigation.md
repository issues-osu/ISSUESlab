# Applying Social Geography to Structural Mitigation in Capital Defense

[![](/images/titlepage.png)](/files/osba.pdf)

**Summary:**  
This project applies social geography and spatial data analysis to strengthen structural mitigation arguments in capital defense. By documenting how neighborhood conditions—including poverty, segregation, environmental stressors, and disinvestment—shape an individual's developmental context and legal outcomes, we provide place-based, legally admissible evidence aligned with Ohio law and ABA mitigation guidelines.

**Research Questions:**  
- **RQ1:** How can spatial analysis of public data reveal community-level risk factors—such as poverty, segregation, and housing instability—that contribute to life trajectories relevant to culpability and sentencing?  
- **RQ2:** In what ways can social geography and structural disadvantage be systematically incorporated into mitigation investigations to support fair, contextualized legal outcomes in death penalty cases?
