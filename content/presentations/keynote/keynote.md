## Real Help–Real Hope: Where Do We Go From Here?  
A Community-Based Approach to the Opioid Crisis

**Summary:**  
This keynote presentation, delivered at the Opioid Treatment Providers of Georgia conference, highlights the need for a comprehensive, public health–centered response to the opioid crisis. It emphasizes how social, environmental, and structural factors—such as poverty, racial inequities, and limited healthcare access—shape opioid-related harms, and critiques punitive policies in favor of community-driven, evidence-based solutions.
