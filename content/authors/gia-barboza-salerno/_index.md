Dr. Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno is an Assistant Professor whose work bridges social work, public health, law, and statistics. Their research examines how neighborhood conditions and environmental exposures shape violence-related harm across the life course—including child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and gun violence—with a focus on equity and structural accountability. Methodologically, their work integrates Bayesian spatial and spatiotemporal modeling, geospatial machine learning, and remote sensing to translate complex data into actionable prevention and policy.

Dr. Barboza-Salerno has published on violence prevention, environmental and spatial determinants of health, and justice-oriented applications of data science, with recent work appearing in *Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy*, *Child Maltreatment*, *Journal of Interpersonal Violence*, and *Journal of Urban Health*. They lead collaborative, community-engaged projects that center marginalized populations and emphasize place-based, trauma-informed prevention.

Their research utilizes nationally representative datasets and administrative records, quasi-experimental designs, and advanced longitudinal methods, including Growth Mixture Modeling, Parallel Process Modeling, and Bayesian space–time approaches.
