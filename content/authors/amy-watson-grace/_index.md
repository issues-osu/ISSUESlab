Dr. Amy Watson-Grace, OTD, OTR/L, BCP is a licensed occupational therapist and PhD candidate in Health & Rehabilitation Sciences at The Ohio State University. Her dissertation, *Exploring Policy, Practice, and Role Perceptions in Multidisciplinary Educational Disability Identification*, investigates how state policy variability and professional practices influence educational identification of autistic students, particularly girls.

Her research spans autism, pain, and disability, with expertise in both qualitative and quantitative methods including multilevel modeling, latent class analysis, and video-based coding of therapy interactions. She has published and presented extensively at international, national, and regional conferences, often as first author, and her work addresses the intersection of policy, practice, and equity in healthcare and education.

Watson-Grace has over 25 years of clinical and teaching experience in occupational therapy, including leadership roles in neonatal care, school-based practice, and community-based services. She is board certified in Pediatrics by the American Occupational Therapy Association and holds certification in Sensory Integration.
