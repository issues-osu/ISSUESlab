bio: "Dr. Karla Shockley McCarthy, PhD, LMSW, TRCC, FSW, is a Principal Investigator and Senior Research Consultant at the Ohio Colleges of Medicine Government Resource Center, where she leads applied health services and population health research. She uses a collaborative team approach to design and execute mixed methods studies, develops survey instrumentation, oversees qualitative and quantitative analyses, and employs various dissemination methods. Her work centers on translating complex data into actionable insights that inform public health. Dr. Shockley McCarthy also engages in research with a focus on trauma-responsive care, occupational well-being, and systems equity. She brings a transdisciplinary lens to her research, integrating social work, education, and geospatial science to examine how structural and environmental conditions shape outcomes for children, families, and frontline professionals.
Dr. Shockley McCarthy’s scholarship includes peer-reviewed publications in journals such as Child Abuse & Neglect, Journal of Family Violence, Social Science & Medicine, and BMC Public Health. Her research employs advanced methodologies, including mixed methods design, structural equation modeling, GIS, process evaluation, measure development and validation, and implementation science. She has led and contributed to studies on child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, opioid misuse, and suicidality among youth, using both primary and secondary data sources - often using large administrative datasets and spatial analysis - to uncover patterns of harm and resilience. Her work has been presented at national and international conferences, including the Society for Social Work and Research, the Council on Social Work Education, and the American Public Health Association.
Her research interests span healthcare and education systems quality and access, child and family resilience, trauma-informed interventions, and the role of relationships and belongingness in promoting well-being. She is particularly focused on how identity and structural inequities intersect to influence life course outcomes. Through her research and mentorship of students across disciplines, Dr. Shockley McCarthy advances data-driven, community-centered solutions. Dr. Shockley McCarthy is also a community lecturer for the Ohio State University College of Social Work and brings over 25 years as an educator, seven years as a licensed mental health professional, and six years as a certified financial social worker."
