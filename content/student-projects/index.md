# ISSUES Lab Undergraduate Research Experience – Fall 2025

**Lab Directors:** Drs. Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno & Karla Shockley-McCarthy  
**Meeting Time:** Wednesdays, 1:00 – 2:00 PM (Zoom)  
**Semester Dates:** August 26, 2025 – December 11, 2025  
**Evaluation:** Pass/Fail (based on participation, assignments, and project engagement)

## Lab Description
The **ISSUES Lab (Investigating Spatial Structures in Urban Environments)** translates environmental exposure into law, policy, and practice. We use geospatial data science, machine learning, and advanced statistical methods to study environmental exposures, trauma, and violence-related harms. Our research bridges social work, public health, law, and statistics, and emphasizes justice-centered approaches that inform prevention and policy.  

The lab is structured around a **three-tiered mentoring model**. Faculty provide direct mentorship and professional development to graduate students and senior researchers (Tier 1); graduate students and advanced lab members mentor undergraduates through project guidance, methods training, and peer collaboration (Tier 2); and undergraduates extend mentorship to newer students or interns, reinforcing their own skills while cultivating leadership (Tier 3). This cascade structure ensures that every member both receives and provides mentorship, building a supportive pipeline for scholarly growth and community impact.  

Undergraduate research assistants complete a structured 16-week curriculum that begins with a competency assessment and personal profile, transitions to project involvement, and culminates in research products and presentations. Students also engage with professional meetings where the lab is presenting (e.g., APHA, WSDS, SSWR, HICE) to connect their work to the broader research community.
