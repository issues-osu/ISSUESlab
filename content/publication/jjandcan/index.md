## Variability and stability in child maltreatment risk across time and space

| | |
| ------------------| ------------------------------ |
| Short description: | This study analyzed substantiated child maltreatment risk in New Mexico from 2007 to 2015 using Bayesian spatial-temporal models at the census tract level. It found that neighborhood factors such as eviction rates, rent burden, urban location, food deserts, low income, lack of vehicle access, and disability prevalence increased maltreatment risk, while greater racial/ethnic diversity was linked to lower risk. The findings highlight the importance of addressing structural housing and social vulnerabilities in targeted child abuse prevention efforts, especially in economically and racially segregated neighborhoods. |
