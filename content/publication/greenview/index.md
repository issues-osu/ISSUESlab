abstract: We examined 899 firearm-related and 2,256 natural deaths in Cook County, Illinois, using a retrospective matched case-control design. Greenness was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index near death locations, tree canopy coverage, green space along walkable streets, and proximity of death to parks. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The relationship between pedestrian-level exposure to green space in different social contexts remains unexplored. We examined 899 firearm-related and 2,256 natural deaths in Cook County, Illinois, using a retrospective matched case-control design. Greenness was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index near death locations, tree canopy coverage, green space along walkable streets, and proximity of death to parks. Two additional greenness measures were derived from Google Street View images, analyzed using machine learning techniques. Associations were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and conditional logistic regression, adjusting for area-level deprivation and racial composition. The green view index derived from street-view imagery (OR = 0.693, p = 0.004), the greenness of walkable streets (OR = 0.787, p = 0.017), and tree canopy coverage (OR = 0.792, p = 0.029) were inversely associated with firearm-related homicide risk. Higher tree canopy coverage (OR = 0.963, p = 0.040) and more localized greenery (OR = 0.552, p = 0.033) provided greater protective effects in less deprived neighborhoods. However, neighborhood racial composition moderated the impact of park proximity on homicide risk (OR = 1.00, p = 0.020). Street-level greenspace is associated with lower odds of homicide and may provide stronger protective effects in more vulnerable neighborhoods

This study examined how pedestrian-level green space relates to firearm-related and natural deaths in Cook County, Illinois, using a matched case-control design. Various greenness measures—including street-view green imagery, tree canopy coverage, and green space along walkable streets—were inversely associated with firearm homicide risk. Protective effects of tree canopy and localized greenery were stronger in less deprived neighborhoods, while neighborhood racial composition influenced the relationship between park proximity and homicide risk. Overall, street-level green space is linked to lower homicide odds and may offer greater protection in vulnerable communities
