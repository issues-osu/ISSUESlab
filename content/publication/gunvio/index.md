title: "Spatial accessibility to gun violence exposure on walkable routes to and from school"
summary: "This study investigates the spatial accessibility of gun violence exposure along walkable routes to and from schools in Englewood, Chicago. Focusing on both direct and indirect forms of gun violence, the study uses acoustic detection technology to quantify the cumulative burden of gun violence exposure potentially encountered by students during their commute to and from school. We examined the spatial distribution of shooting incidents in proximity to schools using network-constrained kernel density estimation, secondary spatial analysis, and rapid realistic routing."

Our work on gun violence in and around schools was acknolwedged by Arizona State University, Criminal Justice Journalists, and the National Criminal Justice Association.
In this paper, we found a staggering level of potential gun violence exposure on walkable street networks near school. 

> Children of color are more likely to be exposed to gun violence on streets near schools. 
The School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act establishes a federal definition of school gun violence. 
To address racial disparities in gun violence, the definition MUST be broadened to consider INDIRECT gun violence exposure that occurs in proximity to schools.

Federal definitions of school gun violence like the School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act must include INDIRECT gun violence on streets near schools to address the disparity.
