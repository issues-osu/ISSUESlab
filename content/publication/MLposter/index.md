Our work on the socio-physical and natural enviornment was presented at the ISPCAN 2024 international conference. 

> No previous research has comprehensively examined how different aspects of the sociophysical and built environments increase child abuse and neglect (CAN) risk.
Characteristics of the built and natural environment are underexplored in research on CAN. Five categories of environmental determinants of child well-being include: (i) urban design, (ii) contaminants, (iii) the parenting environment, (iv) socio-economic conditions, and (v) climate change1
