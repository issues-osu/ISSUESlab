## Course Description

This course provides an overview of research methods that are commonly used in health behavior and health promotion research. The course will address topics such as: choosing a research design, using a theoretical framework, conducting observational and experimental research, measurement and sampling issues, basic analytic approaches of observational and experimental research, and scientific writing. An important goal of this course is to help students develop the necessary skills to read, critique, design, and conduct high-quality scientific research in health behavior and health promotion and, more broadly, public health. The course involves instructor lectures, student discussions, and in-class activities. Therefore, attendance and active participation are essential to completing the course.
