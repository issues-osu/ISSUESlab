Various greenness measures—including street-view green imagery, tree canopy coverage, and green space along walkable streets—were inversely associated with firearm homicide risk. Protective effects of tree canopy and localized greenery were stronger in less deprived neighborhoods, while neighborhood racial composition influenced the relationship between park proximity and homicide risk.

In this paper, we found a staggering level of potential gun violence exposure on walkable street networks near school.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Children of color are more likely to be exposed to gun violence on streets near schools.
The School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act establishes a federal definition of school gun violence.
To address racial disparities in gun violence, the definition MUST be broadened to consider INDIRECT gun violence exposure that occurs in proximity to schools.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>Short description:&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This study analyzed substantiated child maltreatment risk in New Mexico from 2007 to 2015 using Bayesian spatial-temporal models at the census tract level. It found that neighborhood factors such as eviction rates, rent burden, urban location, food deserts, low income, lack of vehicle access, and disability prevalence increased maltreatment risk, while greater racial/ethnic diversity was linked to lower risk. The findings highlight the importance of addressing structural housing and social vulnerabilities in targeted child abuse prevention efforts, especially in economically and racially segregated neighborhoods.&lt;/td>
