We will begin our discussion by addressing some basic definitional questions about states. First of all, what is a state? How is this concept used in the field of comparative politics and how should we define it? What does it mean to say that a state has more or less capacity? What aspects of state capacity are we most concerned with in our analysis of modern nation-states? Finally, what does it mean to say that a state is ‘fragile’ or that a state has ‘failed’? What are some examples of failed states and what are some the implications of state failure and fragility?\nIn module 2.2 we will continue with our discussion of state capacity and asking why some states are stronger than others. We will start with the rise of the modern state in Europe, where we will focus on Charles Tilly’s analysis of Europe.

Many of these injuries involve brain trauma such as concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI).\nNational emergency department data indicate that nearly 900,000 IPV-related visits occurred during the study period, with almost three in five involving craniofacial trauma. Female survivors experienced injury rates nearly five times higher than males, with the starkest disparities in early adulthood (ages 20–34).\nPolicy Relevance Legal Context: Recognition of IPV-related craniofacial injury in statutes and clinical guidelines can improve survivor protections and treatment access. Health Systems: Emergency medicine protocols should include screening for IPV in patients with head, face, and neck injuries. Civil Rights: Survivors face barriers in healthcare and justice systems; data-driven policy is needed to reduce disparities in detection, treatment, and support. Recommendations Mandate IPV screening protocols in emergency departments, especially for craniofacial injuries. Expand Medicaid and social safety net coverage for long-term treatment of IPV-related traumatic brain injuries. Increase funding for prevention and survivor support programs that integrate health and legal services.

Child Maltreatment, 10775595241258452. 10.1177/10775595241258452 PDF\nThe project was led by Barboza, and it was carried out in a large collaboration within our research group.\nAbstract Understanding service disposition pathways is critical to provide deeper insight into why certain subgroups of the population are at risk for recurrent Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement and may highlight disparities across groups or geographic areas. Using the Decision-Making Ecology Framework as a lens, the present study examines whether service disposition pathways are influenced by risk assessment, safety concerns, child age, maltreatment type, previous CPS involvement, and/or county-level structural vulnerability. We linked administrative data from New Mexico’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to data from the American Community Survey. Multilevel models examining associations between case ( N = 12,960) and county ( N = 33) characteristics revealed that both case (age, maltreatment type, risk/safety assessments, previous CPS involvement) and county-level factors (transportation and housing) were associated with service disposition. Additionally, we observed considerable variation at the county level in both the provision of services and the relationship between risk assessment and service provision. By linking different factors of the decision-making process in child welfare cases to intervention strategies, the analysis reveals that the perception of risk can vary based on geographical context resulting in different outcomes for families who have similar risks but different county-level vulnerabilities.\nHighlights Both individual- and county-level covariates significantly predicted referral outcomes. County level variation in both the provision of services and the relationship between risk assessment and service provision. The effect of risk assessment on referral outcomes should not differ by county, but it does for some referral outcomes. Highlights the need for structured decision-making in child welfare investigations. Uses multilevel modeling to examine risk assessment scores following a referral for child maltreatment.

We examined 899 firearm-related and 2,256 natural deaths in Cook County, Illinois, using a retrospective matched case-control design. Greenness was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index near death locations, tree canopy coverage, green space along walkable streets, and proximity of death to parks. Two additional greenness measures were derived from Google Street View images, analyzed using machine learning techniques. Associations were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and conditional logistic regression, adjusting for area-level deprivation and racial composition. The green view index derived from street-view imagery (OR = 0.693, p = 0.004), the greenness of walkable streets (OR = 0.787, p = 0.017), and tree canopy coverage (OR = 0.792, p = 0.029) were inversely associated with firearm-related homicide risk. Higher tree canopy coverage (OR = 0.963, p = 0.040) and more localized greenery (OR = 0.552, p = 0.033) provided greater protective effects in less deprived neighborhoods. However, neighborhood racial composition moderated the impact of park proximity on homicide risk (OR = 1.00, p = 0.020).

To provide unique insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of CAN in relation to COVID-19 outcomes and identify areas where CAN has increased or decreased during the pandemic. Participants were children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the implementation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored. There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reinforce the utility of developing intervention strategies that minimize harm to children by targeting resources to specific challenges facing families enduring the COVID-19 experience.","tags":null,"title":"A spatiotemporal analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on child abuse and neglect in the city of Los Angeles, California","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Lawrence Schiamberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"8e9a3aa3d61774bd8a210a8c54bbf708","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2021-01-01_dual_trajectories_of/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2021-01-01_dual_trajectories_of/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"Postpartum depression and low parental self-efficacy (PSE) are risk factors for poor child behavior.

Given that school experiences and peer relationships therein are central in the lives of adolescents, considerable attention has been directed at the school and peer context of cyberbullying (Barboza, 2015).

However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to formulate and analyze such models which feature game-environment feedback. For instance, a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors of a victim population? For initial answers, we develop a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. We then apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximallycautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory","Computer Science - Multiagent Systems"],"title":"Robust Stochastic Stability in Dynamic and Reactive Environments","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Lori Ann Post","Brian Biroscak","Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"6ad87948efac435efe007f5a90d8ea38","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/sex_violence_prev/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/sex_violence_prev/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sexual Violence Prevalence","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"2e9941213d8e149ee1a7ebbb158fc549","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/adol_context_bully/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/adol_context_bully/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The adolescent parent context and positive youth development in the ecology of cyberbullying.

It affects millions each year and costs billions of dollars annually. Prevention and intervention of elder maltreatment requires a holistic approach that is interdisciplinary and incorporates a variety of diverse theoretical perspectives that fundamentally change how systems of elder care interact and operate. This chapter synthesizes the current knowledge on elder abuse and neglect. It begins by discussing some methodological limitations associated with defining and conceptualizing elder maltreatment along with its consequence for understanding the scope of the problem. It then discusses the individual-level risk and protective factors for elder abuse and neglect across a variety of institutional settings. Next, the risk and protective factors are situated in the context of sociological and criminological theories and a policy framework for elder abuse prevention and intervention based on current evidence-based practices is articulated. The chapter ends by discussing emergent directions that researchers, practitioners and stakeholders must address in order to ensure that our nation's most vulnerable population is free from victimization in variegated settings.","tags":null,"title":"The Theory and Practice of Elder-Abuse Prevention","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Kate Angulski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c27ae3d6904c7ff3a8a1bc09e32b44f7","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_a_descriptive_study_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_a_descriptive_study_/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need. Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using {$chi$}2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment. Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20textendash 39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites. Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.","tags":null,"title":"A Descriptive Study of Racial and Ethnic Differences of Drug Overdoses and Naloxone Administration in Pennsylvania","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c6aa50f9e98264ab36e8bfd0373a46a5","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_a_spatiotemporal_a/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_a_spatiotemporal_a/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"Using a combination of data derived from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration's Behavioral Health Systems Locator and the Boston Police Department's Incident Reports, this study examines the spatiotemporal distribution of calls for medical assistance following a heroin-related injury between 2015 and 2018. As well, an examination is conducted regarding the accessibility of Health Care Centers (HCCs) in relation to individuals in need of medical assistance. Distance-based measures of spatial association, including nearest neighbor and K-function analysis, were used to determine the clustering of calls at various spatial scales. Structural neighborhood characteristics (i.e., distance to the closest HCC) and physical and social vulnerability were used to predict the rate of calls for a heroinrelated injury per 1,000 persons in the city of Boston using a spatial autoregressive model. HCC catchment areas for the set of medical emergency calls were created using Voronoi tessellations. Results showed that the average nearest neighbor distance (NND) of each call for medical assistance was approximately 187 m or .12 miles. Calls for assistance became more probable and increasingly more spatially concentrated over the study period. The K-function analysis revealed that the calls clustered at different spatial scales and in proximity to HCCs. Average distance to the nearest HCC and Household/Disability vulnerability were significantly associated with the census tract call rate per 1,000 persons. The average travel distance between the calls for medical assistance and the nearest HCC was 941 m, or just over a half-mile. Policy implications for the provision, through HCCs, of a focused and comprehensive community-based support system in a large urban city for individuals with serious drug problems are discussed in context.","tags":null,"title":"A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Heroin-Related Calls for Emergency Medical Services and Community-Health Centers in Boston, Massachusetts","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza","Joan Goldsworthy Appel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"89fac129d2164171e97268165ab58d07","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_child_maltreatment_d/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_child_maltreatment_d/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"(Abstract not available)","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment Data in the State of New Mexico across Space and Time","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"88cb88507319bb7391ecbf61f178799f","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_cognitive_readiness_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_cognitive_readiness_/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cognitive Readiness to Parent, Stability and Change in Postpartum Parenting Stress and Social-Emotional Problems in Early Childhood: A Second Order Growth Curve Model","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"22d45c4fb230bac0697c3e44bf060ccc","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_examining_spatial_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_examining_spatial_/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Examining Spatial Regimes of Child Maltreatment Allegations in a Social Vulnerability Framework","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"6c034d80949bbe57fb2b7dbe3780fb5a","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_variability_and_stab/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2020-01-01_variability_and_stab/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Variability and Stability in Child Maltreatment Risk across Time and Space and Its Association with Neighborhood Social \u0026 Housing Vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian Space-Time Model","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia E.

Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment, Delinquent Behavior, and School Factors as Predictors of Depressive Symptoms from Adolescence to Adulthood: A Growth Mixture Model","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia E.

Child maltreatment data on 83,379 child maltreatment cases in 1,678 census tracts spanning 2006-2009 were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Substantiated referral counts were analyzed across census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results showed that the unadjusted yearly rate of child abuse and neglect held fairly steady over the study period decreasing by only 2.57%. However, the temporal term in the spatiotemporal model reflected a downward trend beginning in 2007. High rates of abuse and neglect were predicted by several neighborhood-level measures of structural burden. Every 1-unit decrease in the social vulnerability index reduced the  risk of child abuse and neglect by 98.3% (95% CrI = 1.869-2.1042) while every 1-unit increase in the Black–White dissimilarity index decreased child abuse and neglect risk by 70.6%. The interaction of these variables  demonstrated the protective effect of racial heterogeneity in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. No such effect was found in neighborhoods characterized by low levels of vulnerability. Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the  characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns even after accounting for the role of race and place.","tags":null,"title":"The Geography of Child Maltreatment: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Using Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis With Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"57d3a16a0792352a5e18529bba459e39","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2018-01-01_a_secondary_spatia/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2018-01-01_a_secondary_spatia/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"(Abstract not available)","tags":null,"title":"A Secondary Spatial Analysis of Gun Violence near Boston Schools: A Public Health Approach","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Brian J.

However, many MC prevalence values given differed from those reported in references cited (including all US studies). This and other problems invalidate his adjustments for MC prevalence, undermining most of his meta-regression results. Meta-regression is a highly sophisticated statistical tool and is prone to error if not applied correctly. The study contained a high risk of bias arising from confounding. We also question his use of crude, rather than adjusted, odds ratios and his inclusion of unpublished data, so precluding replication by others.

Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell's model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ``school achievement'' effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children's lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment, School Bonds, and Adult Violence: A Serial Mediation Model","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza","Silvia Dominguez","Laura Siller","Miguel Montalva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"17a4a4e497785c27fee1b67fbf77fec6","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2017-01-01_citizenship_fear_an/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2017-01-01_citizenship_fear_an/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"Purpose textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between Mexicans' support for the criminalization of immigration and level of police contact, fear of deportation and the perceived personal impact of immigration enforcement.","tags":null,"title":"Citizenship, Fear and Support for the Criminalization of Immigration: Contextualizing Mexican Americans' Attitudes about the Role of Law Enforcement","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0fdab20b4c2022a9e2a52044219925aa","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2017-01-01_longitudinal_growth_/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2017-01-01_longitudinal_growth_/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how traumatic experiences (e.g. home removal, violence exposure) influence both depressive and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms in children involved with Child Protective Services (CPS).

This study explores the predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors associated with parents' or guardians' decision to have their child initiate, continue, and complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Methods. Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 9 and 17 years who completed the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey collected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) were analyzed. Utilizing Andersen's health care beliefs model, we explored the sequential nature of the decision to vaccinate (i.e., the decision to receive the first, second, and third dose), thereby allowing the independent variables to vary across each transition. Results. Among all children, 3.7% received exactly 1 shot, 16.3% received at least one shot, and 8.9% received all three shots. Among those who received at least one shot, 22.4% received exactly one shot, 23.7% received exactly 2 shots, and 54.9% completed all 3 shots. A differential impact was observed across transitions. Predisposing factors, such as being Hispanic (OR = 1.9) and child age (OR = 1.4), significantly predicted the decision to receive the first dose but enabling factors, such as having a regular physician (OR = 4.5) and income (OR = .74) were more important for predicting completion. Conclusions. The decision to initiate and complete HPV vaccination depends on a specific mix of enabling, predisposing, and need-based factors. Our analysis underscores the importance of modeling the vaccination decision in a manner that is consistent with how primary caregivers navigate real-life health care decisions for their children.","tags":null,"title":"A Sequential Logit Model of Caretakers' Decision to Vaccinate Children for the Human Papillomavirus Virus in the General Population","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez","Elena Chace"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"8a17926a230d17629b731867b0c25a29","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2016-01-01_physical_victimizati/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2016-01-01_physical_victimizati/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"We investigated whether being attacked physically due to one's gender identity or expression was associated with suicide risk among trans men and women living in Virginia.

Nevertheless, the relative impact of physical victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression. Finally, no significant association was found between multiple measures of institutional discrimination and suicide risk once discriminatory and non-discriminatory physical victimization was taken into account. Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives.","tags":null,"title":"Physical Victimization, Gender Identity and Suicide Risk among Transgender Men and Women","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ce6738e9af0b2f6abac0e2c434254581","permalink":"https://issues-osu/issues/barboza-pubs/2016-01-01_using_behavioral_r/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/issues/barboza-pubs/2016-01-01_using_behavioral_r/","section":"barboza-pubs","summary":"The Human Papilloma Virus (``HPV'') is a common sexually transmitted disease that has infected approximately 79 million men and women in the United States alone.

The present study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of staff physical abuse among elderly individuals receiving nursing home care in Michigan. A random sample of 452 adults with elderly relatives, older than 65 years, and in nursing home care completed a telephone survey regarding elder abuse and neglect experienced by this elder family member in the care setting. Some 24.3% of respondents reported at least one incident of physical abuse by nursing home staff. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the importance of various risk factors in nursing home abuse. Limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), older adult behavioral difficulties, and previous victimization by nonstaff perpetrators were associated with a greater likelihood of physical abuse. Interventions that address these risk factors may be effective in reducing older adult physical abuse in nursing homes. Attention to the contextual or ecological character of nursing home abuse is essential, particularly in light of the findings of this study.","tags":null,"title":"Physical Abuse of Older Adults in Nursing Homes: A Random Sample Survey of Adults With an Elderly Family Member in a Nursing Home","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Lawrence B.

Stress, in the context of caregiving relationships, is a risk factor associated with increased prevalence of elder abuse in familial and institutional settings. As increasing numbers of older adults are moved from family caregiving to nursing home care settings, it becomes important to identify the pattern of elder abuse risk factors in nursing home facilities. An ecological model is proposed for better understanding the risk factors associated with elder abuse in nursing homes and the complex interaction of individual/person characteristics and contextual factors in institutional elder abuse. An ecological perspective to institutional elder abuse provides a framework for guiding and informing future research on the risk factors of nursing home abuse and, in turn, for the development of effective interventions and relevant social policies.","tags":null,"title":"Elder Abuse in Nursing Homes: An Ecological Perspective","type":"barboza-pubs"},{"authors":["Zhenmei Zhang","Lawrence B.

We use geospatial data science, machine learning, and advanced statistical methods to study environmental exposures, trauma, and violence-related harms. Our research bridges social work, public health, law, and statistics, and emphasizes justice-centered approaches that inform prevention and policy.\nThe lab is structured around a three-tiered mentoring model. Faculty provide direct mentorship and professional development to graduate students and senior researchers (Tier 1); graduate students and advanced lab members mentor undergraduates through project guidance, methods training, and peer collaboration (Tier 2); and undergraduates extend mentorship to newer students or interns, reinforcing their own skills while cultivating leadership (Tier 3). This cascade structure ensures that every member both receives and provides mentorship, building a supportive pipeline for scholarly growth and community impact.\nUndergraduate research assistants complete a structured 16-week curriculum that begins with a competency assessment and personal profile, transitions to project involvement, and culminates in research products and presentations. Students also engage with professional meetings where the lab is presenting (e.g., APHA, WSDS, SSWR, HICE) to connect their work to the broader research community.\nRequirements for Pass Attend weekly Wednesday meetings.

Methods: We examined the spatial overlap of child welfare and juvenile justice involvement using multivariate Bayesian spatial modeling.\nResults: Results show a significant positive association between juvenile justice and child maltreatment referrals across neighborhoods. After adjusting for residential instability, immi- grant concentration, and residential racial segregation, children in the least deprived 20 % of neighborhoods were 95.2 % and 55.5 % less likely to be referred to child welfare or justice systems, respectively, compared to those in the most deprived 20 %.\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the value of geospatial analyses to guide public health in- terventions by targeting the shared overlapping risk factors associated with neighborhoods with high risk for both child welfare and juvenile justice system involvement.\nHighlights {{ highlight_1 }} {{ highlight_2 }} {{ highlight_3 }} {{ highlight_4 }} {{ highlight_5 }} Methods Overview We used multivariate Bayesian models.

Population Health}, pages = {101820}, issn = {2352-8273}, doi = {10.1016/j.ssmph.2025.101820}} Gun violence remains a critical public health crisis, particularly in urban centers like Chicago, where firearm-related injuries are among the highest in the nation. These injuries are not randomly distributed; they are spatially concentrated in neighborhoods shaped by structural inequality, including racial segregation, economic disinvestment, and environmental neglect. While random forest models have shown promise in predicting firearm violence and identifying neighborhood-level risk factors, conventional approaches often ignore spatial dependence, leading to biased estimates, inflated variable importance, and reduced geographic generalizability. This study applies spatially explicit machine learning to model non-fatal shootings across Chicago census tracts from 2020 to 2024. A curated set of predictors was compiled, including measures of social and environmental vulnerability, the built environment, and housing inequality. Three research questions guided the analysis: (1) Does incorporating spatial structure via Moran’s Eigenvector Maps (MEMs) in spatial random forests and spatially structured random effects in a Bayesian spatial model improve predictive accuracy compared to non-spatial models? (2) Which neighborhoods exhibit elevated firearm violence risk due to unmeasured spatial processes, as captured by spatial random effects? (3) Does prediction error vary across geographic space, revealing limits to model transferability? Findings suggest that the spatial random forest model outperformed the non-spatial model (pseudo R² = 0.98 vs. test R² = 0.50). Spatial cross-validation revealed geographic variation in accuracy (median nRMSE = 0.76), while spatial random effects from a Bayesian Poisson model identified unexplained latent risk. The enhanced predictive accuracy reveals hidden geographic risk patterns, suggesting that social, structural, and environmental factors can efficiently inform targeted violence prevention strategies.

How we “read” environments with AI \u0026amp; geospatial data Street-level imagery: Systematically collect images via ZenSVI and Mapillary. Objective features (semantic segmentation): Quantify visible elements (e.g., vegetation, sidewalks, buildings) per image. Subjective perceptions (PlacePulse-style models): Score images for safety, upkeep, boredom/depressiveness. Neighborhood data integration: Combine imagery-derived measures with the Area Deprivation Index, Tree Equity Score, and geocoded child neglect reports. Spatial statistical modeling: Relate social/physical environmental factors to neglect reports. What we learn (implications for child welfare systems) Isolate risk factors: Identify objective (green space, infrastructure) and subjective (perceived safety/upkeep) features associated with neglect risk. Target high-risk locations: Detect where environmental exposures align most strongly with neglect. Assess policy relevance: Evaluate whether legal mandates reflect measurable neighborhood conditions. Related ISSUES Lab methods Structural Topic Models (STMs): Extract themes from narratives (e.g., fatality reports, police incidents) and map them. Spatial Random Forests: Predict and map violence-related harms; rank influential environmental and social factors.

While social determinants of suicide are well-established, the role of overlapping social, natural, and built environments remains underexamined.\nMethods We integrated National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data on developed open space, tree canopy, blue space, and a novel measure of land cover diversity with indicators of tree and park equity, built environment features, and socioeconomic vulnerability. Bayesian spatial Poisson models were used to estimate associations between these socioenvironmental variables and suicide risk at the Census Block Group (CBG) level in Chicago. We also identified and compared spatial clusters of high and low suicide risk using Local Moran’s I.\nResults Blue space and developed, open spaces were associated with reduced suicide risk, with estimated decreases of 17.9\nConclusions The findings reveal that the mental health impacts of environmental features are context-dependent and spatially patterned. While access to green and blue space may offer protective effects, these benefits are not uniformly experienced across urban neighborhoods.

Bayesian spatial Poisson models were used to estimate associations between these socioenvironmental variables and suicide risk at the Census Block Group (CBG) level in Chicago. We also identified and compared spatial clusters of high and low suicide risk using Local Moran's I.","tags":null,"title":"The Land Cover Paradox","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barboza","Gia; Duhaney","Sharefa"],"categories":null,"content":"Our work on Utilizing AI-Driven Technology and Geospatial Analysis to Explore Landscape Morphology, Social Vulnerability, and Child Neglect in Los Angeles will be presented at ISUF 2025 in Torino, Italy.\nNo previous research has comprehensively examined how different aspects of the sociophysical and built environments increase child abuse and neglect (CAN) risk.
