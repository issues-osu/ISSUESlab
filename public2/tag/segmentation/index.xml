&lt;p>A Community-Based Approach to the Opioid Crisis&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
This keynote presentation, delivered at the Opioid Treatment Providers of Georgia conference, highlights the need for a comprehensive, public health–centered response to the opioid crisis. It emphasizes how social, environmental, and structural factors—such as poverty, racial inequities, and limited healthcare access—shape opioid-related harms, and critiques punitive policies in favor of community-driven, evidence-based solutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One of the most common tools used in mitigation defense is the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. These experiences are often introduced to demonstrate diminished culpability, impaired development, or increased vulnerability in the client.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>They provide a clinical and developmental framework for understanding the long-term effects of trauma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original framework, which I refer to here as Conventional ACEs or C-ACEs, focuses on family-level adversities. This includes things like physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; neglect; and growing up in a household with substance abuse, domestic violence, or incarceration. These are experiences that happen within the home, usually before the age of 18.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But more recently, researchers and practitioners have pushed for an expanded view—what we call Expanded ACEs or E-ACEs. This broader framework includes adversities that occur outside the household, such as:– Racial and gender discrimination– Exposure to community violence– Chronic poverty or economic hardship– Involvement in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expanded ACEs (E-ACEs) represent a meaningful improvement by including individual-level exposure to community violence, racial and gender discrimination, poverty, and system involvement—adversities that happen beyond the household and are deeply relevant to many of our clients.
But even E-ACEs do not go far enough. They still locate adversity at the individual level—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take, for instance, the difference between experiencing racial discrimination at school and growing up in a hypersegregated, disinvested community of color—a place shaped by decades of redlining, de jure segregation, and economic exclusion. The first is about an individual incident; the second is about a historical and spatial system of harm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Legal context:&lt;/strong> Under California WIC § 300(b)(1), neglect is the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision, placing a child at risk of serious harm. Our lab approaches neglect as both a &lt;strong>public health&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>civil rights&lt;/strong> issue shaped by place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-place-matters">Why place matters&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Neglect risk is not only individual or familial—it’s structured by neighborhoods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Housing quality, access to healthy food, environmental hazards, and local safety often align with legal definitions of neglect.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Street-level imagery:&lt;/strong> Systematically collect images via &lt;strong>ZenSVI&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Mapillary&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Objective features (semantic segmentation):&lt;/strong> Quantify visible elements (e.g., vegetation, sidewalks, buildings) per image.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subjective perceptions (PlacePulse-style models):&lt;/strong> Score images for safety, upkeep, boredom/depressiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Neighborhood data integration:&lt;/strong> Combine imagery-derived measures with the &lt;strong>Area Deprivation Index&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Tree Equity Score&lt;/strong>, and geocoded child neglect reports.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Spatial statistical modeling:&lt;/strong> Relate social/physical environmental factors to neglect reports.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Isolate risk factors:&lt;/strong> Identify objective (green space, infrastructure) and subjective (perceived safety/upkeep) features associated with neglect risk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Target high-risk locations:&lt;/strong> Detect where environmental exposures align most strongly with neglect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Assess policy relevance:&lt;/strong> Evaluate whether legal mandates reflect measurable neighborhood conditions.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Structural Topic Models (STMs):&lt;/strong> Extract themes from narratives (e.g., fatality reports, police incidents) and map them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Spatial Random Forests:&lt;/strong> Predict and map violence-related harms; rank influential environmental and social factors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Predictive analytics:&lt;/strong> Clarify when algorithms aid prevention vs. risk reinforcing inequities.&lt;/li>
