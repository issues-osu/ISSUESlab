In this paper, we found a staggering level of potential gun violence exposure on walkable street networks near school.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Children of color are more likely to be exposed to gun violence on streets near schools.
The School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act establishes a federal definition of school gun violence.
To address racial disparities in gun violence, the definition MUST be broadened to consider INDIRECT gun violence exposure that occurs in proximity to schools.&lt;/p>
