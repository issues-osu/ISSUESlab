Their research examines how neighborhood conditions and environmental exposures shape violence-related harm across the life course—including child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and gun violence—with a focus on equity and structural accountability. Methodologically, their work integrates Bayesian spatial and spatiotemporal modeling, geospatial machine learning, and remote sensing to translate complex data into actionable prevention and policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr. Barboza-Salerno has published on violence prevention, environmental and spatial determinants of health, and justice-oriented applications of data science, with recent work appearing in &lt;em>Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Child Maltreatment&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Journal of Urban Health&lt;/em>. They lead collaborative, community-engaged projects that center marginalized populations and emphasize place-based, trauma-informed prevention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their research utilizes nationally representative datasets and administrative records, quasi-experimental designs, and advanced longitudinal methods, including Growth Mixture Modeling, Parallel Process Modeling, and Bayesian space–time approaches.&lt;/p>

Various greenness measures—including street-view green imagery, tree canopy coverage, and green space along walkable streets—were inversely associated with firearm homicide risk. Protective effects of tree canopy and localized greenery were stronger in less deprived neighborhoods, while neighborhood racial composition influenced the relationship between park proximity and homicide risk.
